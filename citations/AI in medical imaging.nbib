TI  - Context bias. A problem in diagnostic radiology.
PG  - 1752-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether radiologists' interpretations of images are 
      biased by their context and by prevalence of disease in other recently observed 
      cases. METHODS: A test set of 24 right pulmonary arteriograms with a 33% 
      prevalence of pulmonary emboli (PE) was assembled and embedded in 2 larger groups 
      of films. Group A contained 16 additional arteriograms, all showing PE involving 
      the right lung, so that total prevalence was 60%. Group B contained 16 additional 
      arteriograms without PE so that total prevalence was 20%. Six radiologists were 
      randomly assigned to see either group first and then "cross over" to review the 
      other group after a hiatus of at least 8 weeks. The direction of changes in a 
      5-point rating scale for the 2 readings of each film in the test set was compared 
      with the sign test; mean sensitivity, specificity, and areas under receiver 
      operating characteristic (ROC) curves were compared with the paired t test. 
      RESULTS: In the context of group A's higher disease prevalence, radiologists 
      shifted more of their diagnoses toward higher suspicion than expected by chance 
      (P=.03, sign test). In group A, mean sensitivity for diagnosing PE was 
      significantly higher (75% vs 60%; P=.04), and area under the ROC curve was 
      significantly larger (0.88 vs 0.82; P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: Radiologists' diagnoses 
      are significantly influenced by the context of interpretation, even when spectrum 
      and verification bias are avoided. This "context bias" effect is unique to the 
      evaluation of subjectively interpreted tests, and illustrates the difficulty of 
      obtaining unbiased estimates of diagnostic accuracy for both new and existing 
      technologies.

TI  - Tuberculous pleural effusion in children.
PG  - 26-30
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To describe the age distribution, clinical, laboratory, 
      radiographic, and bacteriologic findings of pediatric patients with tuberculous 
      pleural effusion. DESIGN: A retrospective study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have 
      identified all cases of primary pulmonary tuberculosis in children < 18 years, 
      reported to the health department. We have collected information from medical 
      records regarding demographics, clinical findings, bacteriologic results, and 
      evolution. Chest radiographs obtained at the time of initial evaluation were 
      reviewed independently by two groups of radiologists who were blind to the 
      clinical and epidemiologic data. RESULTS: Between January 1983 and December 1996, 
      175 children < 18 years were diagnosed as having primary pulmonary tuberculosis. 
      Among them, 39 patients (22.1%) showed pleural effusion on chest radiograph. The 
      mean age of patients with tuberculous pleural effusion was significantly higher 
      (13.52+/-0.5 years vs 6.97+/-0.42 years). The sensitivity of the tuberculin test 
      is 97.4% for an induration > or = 5 mm. Pleural fluid analysis shows a 
      lymphocytic exudative effusion. Chest radiograph review showed unilateral pleural 
      effusion in all cases. Pleural effusion was the sole radiographic manifestation 
      in 41% of cases. Parenchymal disease is associated in 23 cases (59%). 
      Bacteriologic confirmation of tuberculosis was achieved in 22 cases (56.4%). 
      Cultures of pleural fluid and biopsy material both yielded Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis in 15 of 34 (44.1%) and 12 of 18 (66.6%), respectively, for samples 
      under study. Pleural biopsy specimens showed granulomatous inflammation in 18 of 
      23 cases (78.3%). Antituberculous therapy for 6 to 9 months was effective in all 
      cases. Transient side effects occurred in 1 of 39 patients (2.9%). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Pleural effusion accounts for 22.1% of cases of pediatric pulmonary tuberculosis. 
      Parenchymal consolidation is the most common associated radiographic finding. 
      Bacteriologic confirmation was achieved in 56.4% of cases. A short course of 
      chemotherapy is effective.

TI  - How not to be seen: the contribution of similarity and selective ignoring to 
      sustained inattentional blindness.
PG  - 9-17
AB  - When people attend to objects or events in a visual display, they often fail to 
      notice an additional, unexpected, but fully visible object or event in the same 
      display. This phenomenon is now known as inattentional blindness. We present a 
      new approach to the study of sustained inattentional blindness for dynamic events 
      in order to explore the roles of similarity, distinctiveness, and attentional set 
      in the detection of unexpected objects. In Experiment 1, we found that the 
      similarity of an unexpected object to other objects in the display influences 
      attentional capture: The more similar an unexpected object is to the attended 
      items, and the greater its differencefrom the ignored items, the more likely it 
      is that people will notice it. Experiment 2 explored whether this effect of 
      similarity is driven by selective ignoring of irrelevant items or by selective 
      focusing on attended items. The results of Experiment 3 suggest that the 
      distinctiveness of the unexpected object alone cannot entirely account for the 
      similarity effects found in the first two experiments; when attending to black 
      items or white items in a dynamic display, nearly 30% of observers failed to 
      notice a bright red cross move across the display, even though it had a unique 
      color, luminance, shape, and motion trajectory and was visible for 5s. Together, 
      the results suggest that inattentional blindness for ongoing dynamic events 
      depends both on the similarity of the unexpected object to the other objects in 
      the display and on the observer's attentional set.

TI  - Rapid detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and rifampin resistance by use of 
      on-demand, near-patient technology.

LID - 10.1128/JCM.01463-09 [doi]
AB  - Current nucleic acid amplification methods to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
      are complex, labor-intensive, and technically challenging. We developed and 
      performed the first analysis of the Cepheid Gene Xpert System's MTB/RIF assay, an 
      integrated hands-free sputum-processing and real-time PCR system with rapid 
      on-demand, near-patient technology, to simultaneously detect M. tuberculosis and 
      rifampin resistance. Analytic tests of M. tuberculosis DNA demonstrated a limit 
      of detection (LOD) of 4.5 genomes per reaction. Studies using sputum spiked with 
      known numbers of M. tuberculosis CFU predicted a clinical LOD of 131 CFU/ml. 
      Killing studies showed that the assay's buffer decreased M. tuberculosis 
      viability by at least 8 logs, substantially reducing biohazards. Tests of 23 
      different commonly occurring rifampin resistance mutations demonstrated that all 
      23 (100%) would be identified as rifampin resistant. An analysis of 20 
      nontuberculosis mycobacteria species confirmed high assay specificity. A small 
      clinical validation study of 107 clinical sputum samples from suspected 
      tuberculosis cases in Vietnam detected 29/29 (100%) smear-positive 
      culture-positive cases and 33/39 (84.6%) or 38/53 (71.7%) smear-negative 
      culture-positive cases, as determined by growth on solid medium or on both solid 
      and liquid media, respectively. M. tuberculosis was not detected in 25/25 (100%) 
      of the culture-negative samples. A study of 64 smear-positive culture-positive 
      sputa from retreatment tuberculosis cases in Uganda detected 63/64 (98.4%) 
      culture-positive cases and 9/9 (100%) cases of rifampin resistance. Rifampin 
      resistance was excluded in 54/55 (98.2%) susceptible cases. Specificity rose to 
      100% after correcting for a conventional susceptibility test error. In 
      conclusion, this highly sensitive and simple-to-use system can detect M. 
      tuberculosis directly from sputum in less than 2 h.

      injuries.
PG  - 99-107
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between the degree of midline shift by 
      Computed Tomography (CT) finding and Glasglow Coma Score (GCS) as a predictive of 
      clinical outcome in patients after head injury. METHOD AND METHOD: The present 
      study was performed by retrospectively reviewing 216 consecutive cases of 
      traumatic head injury admitted to the trauma center in Siriraj Hospital from 1999 
      until 2004. All patients were evaluated for level of consciousness by a 
      neurosurgeon determining by GCS and underwent CT brain for evaluation of 
      intracranial hemorrhage and midline shift. The final clinical outcome was also 
      divided into two groups; good outcome for the patients who recovered well with 
      moderate disability and the poor outcome for the patients who suffered severe 
      disability, vegetative status and death. Then, the authors compared midline shift 
      vs. GCS and midline shift vs. clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Total of 216 cases, the 
      three most common types of head injury were motorcycle accident, fall or assault 
      and car accident. 96 of 216 patients had midline shifting, 53 of 96 patients had 
      CT scan of midline shifting less than 10 mm whereas 37 of 96 patients had a CT 
      scan of greater than 10 mm of midline shifting. 63.3% with midline shifting up to 
      10 mm had severe head injury and up to 81% with brain shifting greater than 10 mm 
      had severe head injury. The clinical outcome also showed that poor clinical 
      outcomes correlated to midline shifting greater than 10 mm. CONCLUSION: The 
      increased degree of midline shift in patients with head injuries by CT scan was 
      related to the severity of head injury (GCS = 3-12) and was significantly related 
      to poor final clinical outcome.

TI  - Automated assessment of midline shift in head injury patients.
PG  - 785-90
LID - 10.1016/j.clineuro.2010.06.020 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Midline shift (MLS) is an important quantitative feature for 
      evaluating severity of brain compression by various pathologies, including 
      traumatic intracranial hematomas. In this study, we sought to determine the 
      accuracy and the prognostic value of our computer algorithm that automatically 
      measures the MLS of the brain on computed tomography (CT) images in patients with 
      head injury. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Modelling the deformed midline into three 
      segments, we had designed an algorithm to estimate the MLS automatically. We 
      retrospectively applied our algorithm to the initial CT images of 53 patients 
      with head injury to determine the automated MLS (aMLS) and validated it against 
      that measured by human (hMLS). Both measurements were separately used to predict 
      the neurological outcome of the patients. RESULTS: The hMLS ranged from 0 to 30 
      mm. It was greater than 5 mm in images of 17 patients (32%). In 49 images (92%), 
      the difference between hMLS and aMLS was <1 mm. To detect MLS >5 mm, our 
      algorithm achieved sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 100%. For mortality 
      prediction, aMLS was no worse than hMLS. CONCLUSION: In summary, automated MLS 
      was accurate and predicted outcome as well as that measured manually. This 
      approach might be useful in constructing a fully automated computer-assisted 
      diagnosis system.

AB  - Deep learning allows computational models that are composed of multiple 
      processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of 
      abstraction. These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in 
      speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other 
      domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate 
      structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate 
      how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the 
      representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep 
      convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, 
      speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such 
      as text and speech.

TI  - Midline shift in relation to thickness of traumatic acute subdural hematoma 
      predicts mortality.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Traumatic acute subdural hematoma has a high mortality despite 
      intensive treatment. Despite the existence of several prediction models, it is 
      very hard to predict an outcome. We investigated whether a specific combination 
      of initial head CT-scan findings is a factor in predicting outcome, especially 
      non-survival. METHODS: We retrospectively studied admission head CT scans of all 
      adult patients referred for a traumatic acute subdural hematoma between April 
      2009 and April 2013. Chart review was performed for every included patient. 
      Midline shift and thickness of the hematoma were measured by two independent 
      observers. The difference between midline shift and thickness of the hematoma was 
      calculated. These differences were correlated with outcome. IRB has approved the 
      study. RESULTS: A total of 59 patients were included, of whom 29 died. We found a 
      strong correlation between a midline shift exceeding the thickness of the 
      hematoma by 3 mm or more, and subsequent mortality. For each evaluation, 
      specificity was 1.0 (95 % CI: 0.85-1 for all evaluations), positive predictive 
      value 1.0 (95 % CI between 0.31-1 and 0.56-1), while sensitivity ranged from 0.1 
      to 0.23 (95 % CI between 0.08-0.39 and 0.17-0.43), and negative predictive value 
      varied from 0.52 to 0.56 (95 % CI between 0.38-0.65 and 0.41-0.69). CONCLUSIONS: 
      In case of a traumatic acute subdural hematoma, a difference between the midline 
      shift and the thickness of the hematoma >/= 3 mm at the initial CT predicted 
      mortality in all cases. This is the first time that such a strong correlation was 
      reported. Especially for the future development of prediction models, the 
      relation between midline shift and thickness of the hematoma could be included as 
      a separate factor.

TI  - Bias in Radiology: The How and Why of Misses and Misinterpretations.
PG  - 236-247
LID - 10.1148/rg.2018170107 [doi]
AB  - Medical errors are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the medical 
      field and are substantial contributors to medical costs. Radiologists play an 
      integral role in the diagnosis and care of patients and, given that those in this 
      field interpret millions of examinations annually, may therefore contribute to 
      diagnostic errors. Errors can be categorized as a "miss" when a primary or 
      critical finding is not observed or as a "misinterpretation" when errors in 
      interpretation lead to an incorrect diagnosis. In this article, the authors 
      describe the cognitive causes of such errors in diagnostic medicine, specifically 
      in radiology. Recognizing the cognitive processes that radiologists use while 
      interpreting images should improve one's awareness of the inherent biases that 
      can impact decision making. The authors review the common biases that impact 
      clinical decisions, as well as strategies to counteract or minimize the potential 
      for misdiagnosis. System-level processes that can be implemented to minimize 
      cognitive errors are reviewed, as well as ways to implement personal changes to 
      minimize cognitive errors in daily practice. ((c))RSNA, 2017.

TI  - Basilar Skull Fractures.
BTI - StatPearls
AB  - Basilar skull fractures, usually caused by substantial blunt force trauma, 
      involve at least one of the bones that compose the base of the skull. Basilar 
      skull fractures most commonly involve the temporal bones but may involve the 
      occipital, sphenoid, ethmoid, and the orbital plate of the frontal bone as well. 
      Several clinical exam findings highly predictive of basilar skull fractures 
      include hemotympanum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) otorrhea or rhinorrhea, Battle 
      sign (retroauricular or mastoid ecchymosis), and raccoon eyes (periorbital 
      ecchymosis). Basilar skull fractures are commonly associated with facial 
      fractures, cervical spine injury, intracranial hemorrhage, cranial nerve injury, 
      vascular injury, and meningitis. Basilar skull fractures are most commonly seen 
      in younger people due to their propensity to do high-risk activities. The 
      majority of basilar skull fractures are managed with conservative care.

TI  - Flail Chest.
BTI - StatPearls
AB  - Flail chest is a traumatic injury of the thorax that involves fractures of 3 or 
      more ribs in at least 2 places (see Image. Three-Dimensional Reconstruction of 
      Flail Chest). Although this definition is widely used, clinical findings show 
      that even smaller segments involving 1 or 2 ribs can function as flail segments 
      if they move independently and generate negative intrapleural pressure. The 
      Western Trauma Association, in its rib fracture algorithm, describes this 
      anatomical pattern as a disconnected portion of the chest wall that moves 
      paradoxically inward during inspiration. Flail chest is fundamentally a clinical 
      diagnosis, as not all patients with this fracture pattern exhibit clinical signs 
      of paradoxical motion. This injury disrupts normal respiratory mechanics and 
      imposes a greater physiological burden on older patients and those with chronic 
      pulmonary disease. Flail chest frequently results from severe blunt thoracic 
      trauma and often occurs along with other high-impact injuries. Pain and 
      associated trauma both contribute to the complexity of treatment. Although most 
      cases are unilateral, bilateral involvement can occur. Radiographic findings may 
      suggest flail chest, but clinical observation of paradoxical movement confirms 
      the diagnosis.

TI  - Association Between Surgical Skin Markings in Dermoscopic Images and Diagnostic 
      Performance of a Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network for Melanoma 
      Recognition.
PG  - 1135-1141
LID - 10.1001/jamadermatol.2019.1735 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown a 
      performance at the level of dermatologists in the diagnosis of melanoma. 
      Accordingly, further exploring the potential limitations of CNN technology before 
      broadly applying it is of special interest. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the 
      association between gentian violet surgical skin markings in dermoscopic images 
      and the diagnostic performance of a CNN approved for use as a medical device in 
      the European market. DESIGN AND SETTING: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted 
      from August 1, 2018, to November 30, 2018, using a CNN architecture trained with 
      more than 120 000 dermoscopic images of skin neoplasms and corresponding 
      diagnoses. The association of gentian violet skin markings in dermoscopic images 
      with the performance of the CNN was investigated in 3 image sets of 130 
      melanocytic lesions each (107 benign nevi, 23 melanomas). EXPOSURES: The same 
      lesions were sequentially imaged with and without the application of a gentian 
      violet surgical skin marker and then evaluated by the CNN for their probability 
      of being a melanoma. In addition, the markings were removed by manually cropping 
      the dermoscopic images to focus on the melanocytic lesion. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) of the 
      receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the CNN's diagnostic 
      classification in unmarked, marked, and cropped images. RESULTS: In all, 130 
      melanocytic lesions (107 benign nevi and 23 melanomas) were imaged. In unmarked 
      lesions, the CNN achieved a sensitivity of 95.7% (95% CI, 79%-99.2%) and a 
      specificity of 84.1% (95% CI, 76.0%-89.8%). The ROC AUC was 0.969. In marked 
      lesions, an increase in melanoma probability scores was observed that resulted in 
      a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI, 85.7%-100%) and a significantly reduced 
      specificity of 45.8% (95% CI, 36.7%-55.2%, P < .001). The ROC AUC was 0.922. 
      Cropping images led to the highest sensitivity of 100% (95% CI, 85.7%-100%), 
      specificity of 97.2% (95% CI, 92.1%-99.0%), and ROC AUC of 0.993. Heat maps 
      created by vanilla gradient descent backpropagation indicated that the blue 
      markings were associated with the increased false-positive rate. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: This study's findings suggest that skin markings significantly 
      interfered with the CNN's correct diagnosis of nevi by increasing the melanoma 
      probability scores and consequently the false-positive rate. A predominance of 
      skin markings in melanoma training images may have induced the CNN's association 
      of markings with a melanoma diagnosis. Accordingly, these findings suggest that 
      skin markings should be avoided in dermoscopic images intended for analysis by a 
      CNN. TRIAL REGISTRATION: German Clinical Trial Register (DRKS) Identifier:

TI  - BioBERT: a pre-trained biomedical language representation model for biomedical 
      text mining.
PG  - 1234-1240
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btz682 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Biomedical text mining is becoming increasingly important as the 
      number of biomedical documents rapidly grows. With the progress in natural 
      language processing (NLP), extracting valuable information from biomedical 
      literature has gained popularity among researchers, and deep learning has boosted 
      the development of effective biomedical text mining models. However, directly 
      applying the advancements in NLP to biomedical text mining often yields 
      unsatisfactory results due to a word distribution shift from general domain 
      corpora to biomedical corpora. In this article, we investigate how the recently 
      introduced pre-trained language model BERT can be adapted for biomedical corpora. 
      RESULTS: We introduce BioBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from 
      Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining), which is a domain-specific language 
      representation model pre-trained on large-scale biomedical corpora. With almost 
      the same architecture across tasks, BioBERT largely outperforms BERT and previous 
      state-of-the-art models in a variety of biomedical text mining tasks when 
      pre-trained on biomedical corpora. While BERT obtains performance comparable to 
      that of previous state-of-the-art models, BioBERT significantly outperforms them 
      on the following three representative biomedical text mining tasks: biomedical 
      named entity recognition (0.62% F1 score improvement), biomedical relation 
      extraction (2.80% F1 score improvement) and biomedical question answering (12.24% 
      MRR improvement). Our analysis results show that pre-training BERT on biomedical 
      corpora helps it to understand complex biomedical texts. AVAILABILITY AND 
      IMPLEMENTATION: We make the pre-trained weights of BioBERT freely available at 
      https://github.com/naver/biobert-pretrained, and the source code for fine-tuning 
      BioBERT available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/biobert.

TI  - Fully Automated CT Quantification of Epicardial Adipose Tissue by Deep Learning: 
      A Multicenter Study.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the performance of deep learning for robust and fully 
      automated quantification of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) from multicenter 
      cardiac CT data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this multicenter study, a 
      convolutional neural network approach was trained to quantify EAT on non-contrast 
      material-enhanced calcium-scoring CT scans from multiple cohorts, scanners, and 
      protocols (n = 850). Deep learning performance was compared with the performance 
      of three expert readers and with interobserver variability in a subset of 141 
      scans. The deep learning algorithm was incorporated into research software. 
      Automated EAT progression was compared with expert measurements for 70 patients 
      with baseline and follow-up scans. RESULTS: Automated quantification was 
      performed in a mean (+/- standard deviation) time of 1.57 seconds +/- 0.49, compared 
      with 15 minutes for experts. Deep learning provided high agreement with expert 
      manual quantification for all scans (R = 0.974; P < .001), with no significant 
      bias (0.53 cm(3); P = .13). Manual EAT volumes measured by two experienced 
      readers were highly correlated (R = 0.984; P < .001) but with a bias of 4.35 
      cm(3) (P < .001). Deep learning quantifications were highly correlated with the 
      measurements of both experts (R = 0.973 and R = 0.979; P < .001), with 
      significant bias for reader 1 (5.11 cm(3); P < .001) but not for reader 2 (0.88 
      cm(3); P = .26). EAT progression by deep learning correlated strongly with manual 
      EAT progression (R = 0.905; P < .001) in 70 patients, with no significant bias 
      (0.64 cm(3); P = .43), and was related to an increased noncalcified plaque burden 
      quantified from coronary CT angiography (5.7% vs 1.8%; P = .026). CONCLUSION: 
      Deep learning allows rapid, robust, and fully automated quantification of EAT 
      from calcium scoring CT. It performs as well as an expert reader and can be 
      implemented for routine cardiovascular risk assessment.(c) RSNA, 2019See also the

AB  - PURPOSE: To design a computational method for automatic brain glioma segmentation 
      of multimodal MRI scans with high efficiency and accuracy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      The 2018 Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS) dataset was used 
      in this study, consisting of routine clinically acquired preoperative multimodal 
      MRI scans. Three subregions of glioma-the necrotic and nonenhancing tumor core, 
      the peritumoral edema, and the contrast-enhancing tumor-were manually labeled by 
      experienced radiologists. Two-dimensional U-Net models were built using a 
      three-plane-assembled approach to segment three subregions individually 
      (three-region model) or to segment only the whole tumor (WT) region (WT-only 
      model). The term three-plane-assembled means that coronal and sagittal images 
      were generated by reformatting the original axial images. The model performance 
      for each case was evaluated in three classes: enhancing tumor (ET), tumor core 
      (TC), and WT. RESULTS: On the internal unseen testing dataset split from the 2018 
      BraTS training dataset, the proposed models achieved mean Sorensen-Dice scores of 
      0.80, 0.84, and 0.91, respectively, for ET, TC, and WT. On the BraTS validation 
      dataset, the proposed models achieved mean 95% Hausdorff distances of 3.1 mm, 7.0 
      mm, and 5.0 mm, respectively, for ET, TC, and WT and mean Sorensen-Dice scores of 
      0.80, 0.83, and 0.91, respectively, for ET, TC, and WT. On the BraTS testing 
      dataset, the proposed models ranked fourth out of 61 teams. The source code is 
      available at https://github.com/GuanLab/Brain_Glioma. CONCLUSION: This deep 
      learning method consistently segmented subregions of brain glioma with high 
      accuracy, efficiency, reliability, and generalization ability on screening images 
      from a large population, and it can be efficiently implemented in clinical 
      practice to assist neuro-oncologists or radiologists. Supplemental material is 
      available for this article. (c) RSNA, 2020.

TI  - Impact of Confounding Thoracic Tubes and Pleural Dehiscence Extent on Artificial 
      Intelligence Pneumothorax Detection in Chest Radiographs.
PG  - 792-798
LID - 10.1097/RLI.0000000000000707 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that published performances of algorithms for 
      artificial intelligence (AI) pneumothorax (PTX) detection in chest radiographs 
      (CXRs) do not sufficiently consider the influence of PTX size and confounding 
      effects caused by thoracic tubes (TTs). Therefore, we established a 
      radiologically annotated benchmarking cohort (n = 6446) allowing for a detailed 
      subgroup analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified 6434 
      supine CXRs, among them 1652 PTX-positive cases and 4782 PTX-negative cases. 
      Supine CXRs were radiologically annotated for PTX size, PTX location, and 
      inserted TTs. The diagnostic performances of 2 AI algorithms ("AI_CheXNet" 
      [Rajpurkar et al], "AI_1.5" [Guendel et al]), both trained on publicly available 
      datasets with labels obtained from automatic report interpretation, were 
      quantified. The algorithms' discriminative power for PTX detection was quantified 
      by the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC), and 
      significance analysis was based on the corresponding 95% confidence interval. A 
      detailed subgroup analysis was performed to quantify the influence of PTX size 
      and the confounding effects caused by inserted TTs. RESULTS: Algorithm 
      performance was quantified as follows: overall performance with AUROCs of 0.704 
      (AI_1.5) / 0.765 (AI_CheXNet) for unilateral PTXs, AUROCs of 0.666 (AI_1.5) / 
      0.722 (AI_CheXNet) for unilateral PTXs smaller than 1 cm, and AUROCs of 0.735 
      (AI_1.5) / 0.818 (AI_CheXNet) for unilateral PTXs larger than 2 cm. Subgroup 
      analysis identified TTs to be strong confounders that significantly influence 
      algorithm performance: Discriminative power is completely eliminated by analyzing 
      PTX-positive cases without TTs referenced to control PTX-negative cases with 
      inserted TTs. Contrarily, AUROCs increased up to 0.875 (AI_CheXNet) for large 
      PTX-positive cases with inserted TTs referenced to control cases without TTs. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our detailed subgroup analysis demonstrated that the performance of 
      established AI algorithms for PTX detection trained on public datasets strongly 
      depends on PTX size and is significantly biased by confounding image features, 
      such as inserted TTS. Our established, clinically relevant and radiologically 
      annotated benchmarking cohort might be of great benefit for ongoing algorithm 
      development.

TI  - Federated learning in medicine: facilitating multi-institutional collaborations 
      without sharing patient data.
PG  - 12598

AB  - Several studies underscore the potential of deep learning in identifying complex 
      patterns, leading to diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Identifying 
      sufficiently large and diverse datasets, required for training, is a significant 
      challenge in medicine and can rarely be found in individual institutions. 
      Multi-institutional collaborations based on centrally-shared patient data face 
      privacy and ownership challenges. Federated learning is a novel paradigm for 
      data-private multi-institutional collaborations, where model-learning leverages 
      all available data without sharing data between institutions, by distributing the 
      model-training to the data-owners and aggregating their results. We show that 
      federated learning among 10 institutions results in models reaching 99% of the 
      model quality achieved with centralized data, and evaluate generalizability on 
      data from institutions outside the federation. We further investigate the effects 
      of data distribution across collaborating institutions on model quality and 
      learning patterns, indicating that increased access to data through data private 
      multi-institutional collaborations can benefit model quality more than the errors 
      introduced by the collaborative method. Finally, we compare with other 
      collaborative-learning approaches demonstrating the superiority of federated 
      learning, and discuss practical implementation considerations. Clinical adoption 
      of federated learning is expected to lead to models trained on datasets of 
      unprecedented size, hence have a catalytic impact towards precision/personalized 
      medicine.

AB  - Acute critical illness is often preceded by deterioration of routinely measured 
      clinical parameters, e.g., blood pressure and heart rate. Early clinical 
      prediction is typically based on manually calculated screening metrics that 
      simply weigh these parameters, such as early warning scores (EWS). The predictive 
      performance of EWSs yields a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity that 
      can lead to negative outcomes for the patient. Previous work on electronic health 
      records (EHR) trained artificial intelligence (AI) systems offers promising 
      results with high levels of predictive performance in relation to the early, 
      real-time prediction of acute critical illness. However, without insight into the 
      complex decisions by such system, clinical translation is hindered. Here, we 
      present an explainable AI early warning score (xAI-EWS) system for early 
      detection of acute critical illness. xAI-EWS potentiates clinical translation by 
      accompanying a prediction with information on the EHR data explaining it.

TI  - Deep Learning for Hierarchical Severity Staging of Anterior Cruciate Ligament 
      Injuries from MRI.
PG  - e190207

LID - e190207
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic utility of two convolutional neural networks 
      (CNNs) for severity staging of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, 1243 knee MR images (1008 
      intact, 18 partially torn, 77 fully torn, and 140 reconstructed ACLs) from 224 
      patients (mean age, 47 years +/- 14 [standard deviation]; 54% women) were analyzed. 
      The MRI examinations were performed between 2011 and 2014. A modified scoring 
      metric was used. Classification of ACL injuries using deep learning involved use 
      of two types of CNN, one with three-dimensional (3D) and the other with 
      two-dimensional (2D) convolutional kernels. Performance metrics included 
      sensitivity, specificity, weighted Cohen kappa, and overall accuracy, and the McNemar 
      test was used to compare the performance of the CNNs. RESULTS: The overall 
      accuracies for ACL injury classification using the 3D CNN and 2D CNN were 89% 
      (225 of 254) and 92% (233 of 254), respectively (P = .27), and both CNNs had a 
      weighted Cohen kappa of 0.83. The 2D CNN and 3D CNN performed similarly in 
      classifying intact ACLs (2D CNN, sensitivity of 93% [188 of 203] and specificity 
      of 90% [46 of 51] vs 3D CNN, sensitivity of 89% [180 of 203] and specificity of 
      88% [45 of 51]). Classification of full tears by both networks was also 
      comparable (2D CNN, sensitivity of 82% [14 of 17] and specificity of 94% [222 of 
      237] vs 3D CNN, sensitivity of 76% [13 of 17] and specificity of 100% [236 of 
      237]). The 2D CNN classified all reconstructed ACLs correctly. CONCLUSION: 
      Two-dimensional and 3D CNNs applied to ACL lesion classification had high 
      sensitivity and specificity, suggesting that these networks could be used to help 
      nonexperts grade ACL injuries. Supplemental material is available for this 
      article. (c) RSNA, 2020.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: There has been a rapid development of deep learning (DL) models for 
      medical imaging. However, DL requires a large labeled dataset for training the 
      models. Getting large-scale labeled data remains a challenge, and multi-center 
      datasets suffer from heterogeneity due to patient diversity and varying imaging 
      protocols. Domain adaptation (DA) has been developed to transfer the knowledge 
      from a labeled data domain to a related but unlabeled domain in either image 
      space or feature space. DA is a type of transfer learning (TL) that can improve 
      the performance of models when applied to multiple different datasets. OBJECTIVE: 
      In this survey, we review the state-of-the-art DL-based DA methods for medical 
      imaging. We aim to summarize recent advances, highlighting the motivation, 
      challenges, and opportunities, and to discuss promising directions for future 
      work in DA for medical imaging. METHODS: We surveyed peer-reviewed publications 
      from leading biomedical journals and conferences between 2017-2020, that reported 
      the use of DA in medical imaging applications, grouping them by methodology, 
      image modality, and learning scenarios. RESULTS: We mainly focused on pathology 
      and radiology as application areas. Among various DA approaches, we discussed 
      domain transformation (DT) and latent feature-space transformation (LFST). We 
      highlighted the role of unsupervised DA in image segmentation and described 
      opportunities for future development. CONCLUSION: DA has emerged as a promising 
      solution to deal with the lack of annotated training data. Using adversarial 
      techniques, unsupervised DA has achieved good performance, especially for 
      segmentation tasks. Opportunities include domain transferability, multi-modal DA, 
      and applications that benefit from synthetic data.

TI  - Hidden Stratification Causes Clinically Meaningful Failures in Machine Learning 
      for Medical Imaging.
PG  - 151-159
LID - 10.1145/3368555.3384468 [doi]
AB  - Machine learning models for medical image analysis often suffer from poor 
      performance on important subsets of a population that are not identified during 
      training or testing. For example, overall performance of a cancer detection model 
      may be high, but the model may still consistently miss a rare but aggressive 
      cancer subtype. We refer to this problem as hidden stratification, and observe 
      that it results from incompletely describing the meaningful variation in a 
      dataset. While hidden stratification can substantially reduce the clinical 
      efficacy of machine learning models, its effects remain difficult to measure. In 
      this work, we assess the utility of several possible techniques for measuring 
      hidden stratification effects, and characterize these effects both via synthetic 
      experiments on the CIFAR-100 benchmark dataset and on multiple real-world medical 
      imaging datasets. Using these measurement techniques, we find evidence that 
      hidden stratification can occur in unidentified imaging subsets with low 
      prevalence, low label quality, subtle distinguishing features, or spurious 
      correlates, and that it can result in relative performance differences of over 
      20% on clinically important subsets. Finally, we discuss the clinical 
      implications of our findings, and suggest that evaluation of hidden 
      stratification should be a critical component of any machine learning deployment 
      in medical imaging.

TI  - Federated learning: a collaborative effort to achieve better medical imaging 
      models for individual sites that have small labelled datasets.
PG  - 852-857
LID - 10.21037/qims-20-595 [doi]
AB  - Despite the overall success of using artificial intelligence (AI) to assist 
      radiologists in performing computer-aided patient diagnosis, it remains 
      challenging to build good models with small datasets at individual sites. Because 
      many medical images do not come with proper labelling for training, this requires 
      radiologists to perform strenuous labelling work and to prepare the dataset for 
      training. Placing such demands on radiologists is unsustainable, given the 
      ever-increasing number of medical images taken each year. We propose an 
      alternative solution using a relatively new learning framework. This framework, 
      called federated learning, allows individual sites to train a global model in a 
      collaborative effort. Federated learning involves aggregating training results 
      from multiple sites to create a global model without directly sharing datasets. 
      This ensures that patient privacy is maintained across sites. Furthermore, the 
      added supervision obtained from the results of partnering sites improves the 
      global model's overall detection abilities. This alleviates the issue of 
      insufficient supervision when training AI models with small datasets. Lastly, we 
      also address the major challenges of adopting federated learning.

      data sharing.
PG  - 1259-1264
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocaa341 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate enabling multi-institutional training without 
      centralizing or sharing the underlying physical data via federated learning (FL). 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Deep learning models were trained at each participating 
      institution using local clinical data, and an additional model was trained using 
      FL across all of the institutions. RESULTS: We found that the FL model exhibited 
      superior performance and generalizability to the models trained at single 
      institutions, with an overall performance level that was significantly better 
      than that of any of the institutional models alone when evaluated on held-out 
      test sets from each institution and an outside challenge dataset. DISCUSSION: The 
      power of FL was successfully demonstrated across 3 academic institutions while 
      avoiding the privacy risk associated with the transfer and pooling of patient 
      data. CONCLUSION: Federated learning is an effective methodology that merits 
      further study to enable accelerated development of models across institutions, 
      enabling greater generalizability in clinical use.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare rib fracture detection and classification by radiologists 
      using CT images with and without a deep learning model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 
      total of 8529 chest CT images were collected from multiple hospitals for training 
      the deep learning model. The test dataset included 300 chest CT images acquired 
      using a single CT scanner. The rib fractures were marked in the bone window on 
      each CT slice by experienced radiologists, and the ground truth included 861 rib 
      fractures. We proposed a heterogeneous neural network for rib fracture detection 
      and classification consisting of a cascaded feature pyramid network and a 
      classification network. The deep learning-based model was evaluated based on the 
      external testing data. The precision rate, recall rate, F1-score, and diagnostic 
      time of two junior radiologists with and without the deep learning model were 
      computed, and the Chi-square, one-way analysis of variance, and least significant 
      difference tests were used to analyze the results. RESULTS: The use of the deep 
      learning model increased detection recall and classification accuracy (0.922 and 
      0.863) compared with the radiologists alone (0.812 vs. 0.850). The radiologists 
      achieved a higher precision rate, recall rate, and F1-score for fracture 
      detection when using the deep learning model, at 0.943, 0.978, and 0.960, 
      respectively. When using the deep learning model, the radiologist's reading time 
      was decreased from 158.3 +/- 35.7 s to 42.3 +/- 6.8 s. CONCLUSION: Radiologists 
      achieved the highest performance in diagnosing and classifying rib fractures on 
      CT images when assisted by the deep learning model.

TI  - Pneumothorax detection in chest radiographs: optimizing artificial intelligence 
      system for accuracy and confounding bias reduction using in-image annotations in 
      algorithm training.
PG  - 7888-7900
LID - 10.1007/s00330-021-07833-w [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Diagnostic accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) pneumothorax 
      (PTX) detection in chest radiographs (CXR) is limited by the noisy annotation 
      quality of public training data and confounding thoracic tubes (TT). We 
      hypothesize that in-image annotations of the dehiscent visceral pleura for 
      algorithm training boosts algorithm's performance and suppresses confounders. 
      METHODS: Our single-center evaluation cohort of 3062 supine CXRs includes 760 
      PTX-positive cases with radiological annotations of PTX size and inserted TTs. 
      Three step-by-step improved algorithms (differing in algorithm architecture, 
      training data from public datasets/clinical sites, and in-image annotations 
      included in algorithm training) were characterized by area under the receiver 
      operating characteristics (AUROC) in detailed subgroup analyses and referenced to 
      the well-established "CheXNet" algorithm. RESULTS: Performances of established 
      algorithms exclusively trained on publicly available data without in-image 
      annotations are limited to AUROCs of 0.778 and strongly biased towards TTs that 
      can completely eliminate algorithm's discriminative power in individual 
      subgroups. Contrarily, our final "algorithm 2" which was trained on a lower 
      number of images but additionally with in-image annotations of the dehiscent 
      pleura achieved an overall AUROC of 0.877 for unilateral PTX detection with a 
      significantly reduced TT-related confounding bias. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated 
      strong limitations of an established PTX-detecting AI algorithm that can be 
      significantly reduced by designing an AI system capable of learning to both 
      classify and localize PTX. Our results are aimed at drawing attention to the 
      necessity of high-quality in-image localization in training data to reduce the 
      risks of unintentionally biasing the training process of pathology-detecting AI 
      algorithms. KEY POINTS: * Established pneumothorax-detecting artificial 
      intelligence algorithms trained on public training data are strongly limited and 
      biased by confounding thoracic tubes. * We used high-quality in-image annotated 
      training data to effectively boost algorithm performance and suppress the impact 
      of confounding thoracic tubes. * Based on our results, we hypothesize that even 
      hidden confounders might be effectively addressed by in-image annotations of 
      pathology-related image features.

AB  - PURPOSE: To train a deep learning classification algorithm to predict chest 
      radiograph severity scores and clinical outcomes in patients with coronavirus 
      disease 2019 (COVID-19). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort 
      study, patients aged 21-50 years who presented to the emergency department (ED) 
      of a multicenter urban health system from March 10 to 26, 2020, with COVID-19 
      confirmation at real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction 
      screening were identified. The initial chest radiographs, clinical variables, and 
      outcomes, including admission, intubation, and survival, were collected within 30 
      days (n = 338; median age, 39 years; 210 men). Two fellowship-trained 
      cardiothoracic radiologists examined chest radiographs for opacities and assigned 
      a clinically validated severity score. A deep learning algorithm was trained to 
      predict outcomes on a holdout test set composed of patients with confirmed 
      COVID-19 who presented between March 27 and 29, 2020 (n = 161; median age, 60 
      years; 98 men) for both younger (age range, 21-50 years; n = 51) and older (age 
      >50 years, n = 110) populations. Bootstrapping was used to compute CIs. RESULTS: 
      The model trained on the chest radiograph severity score produced the following 
      areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs): 0.80 (95% CI: 
      0.73, 0.88) for the chest radiograph severity score, 0.76 (95% CI: 0.68, 0.84) 
      for admission, 0.66 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.75) for intubation, and 0.59 (95% CI: 0.49, 
      0.69) for death. The model trained on clinical variables produced an AUC of 0.64 
      (95% CI: 0.55, 0.73) for intubation and an AUC of 0.59 (95% CI: 0.50, 0.68) for 
      death. Combining chest radiography and clinical variables increased the AUC of 
      intubation and death to 0.88 (95% CI: 0.79, 0.96) and 0.82 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.91), 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: The combination of imaging and clinical information 
      improves outcome predictions.Supplemental material is available for this

TI  - Binomial Classification of Pediatric Elbow Fractures Using a Deep Learning 
      Multiview Approach Emulating Radiologist Decision Making.

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the feasibility of using deep learning with a multiview 
      approach, similar to how a human radiologist reviews multiple images, for 
      binomial classification of acute pediatric elbow radiographic abnormalities. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 21 456 radiographic studies containing 58 817 
      images of the elbow and associated radiology reports over the course of a 4-year 
      period from January 2014 through December 2017 at a dedicated children's hospital 
      were retrospectively retrieved. Mean age was 7.2 years, and 43% were female 
      patients. The studies were binomially classified, based on the reports, as either 
      positive or negative for acute or subacute traumatic abnormality. The studies 
      were randomly divided into a training set containing 20 350 studies and a 
      validation set containing the remaining 1106 studies. A multiview approach was 
      used for the model by combining both a convolutional neural network and recurrent 
      neural network to interpret an entire series of three radiographs together. 
      Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, 
      area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and their 95% 
      confidence intervals were calculated. RESULTS: AUC was 0.95, and accuracy was 88% 
      for the model on the studied dataset. Sensitivity for the model was 91% (536 of 
      590), while the specificity for the model was 84% (434 of 516). Of 241 
      supracondylar fractures, one was missed. Of 88 lateral condylar fractures, one 
      was missed. Of 77 elbow effusions without fracture, 15 were missed. Of 184 other 
      abnormalities, 37 were missed. CONCLUSION: Deep learning can effectively classify 
      acute and nonacute pediatric elbow abnormalities on radiographs in the setting of 
      trauma. A recurrent neural network was used to classify an entire radiographic 
      series, arrive at a decision based on all views, and identify fractures in 
      pediatric patients with variable skeletal immaturity.Supplemental material is 
      available for this article.(c) RSNA, 2019.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the performance, agreement, and efficiency of a fully 
      convolutional network (FCN) for liver lesion detection and segmentation at CT 
      examinations in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CLMs). MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: This retrospective study evaluated an automated method using an FCN that 
      was trained, validated, and tested with 115, 15, and 26 contrast 
      material-enhanced CT examinations containing 261, 22, and 105 lesions, 
      respectively. Manual detection and segmentation by a radiologist was the 
      reference standard. Performance of fully automated and user-corrected 
      segmentations was compared with that of manual segmentations. The interuser 
      agreement and interaction time of manual and user-corrected segmentations were 
      assessed. Analyses included sensitivity and positive predictive value of 
      detection, segmentation accuracy, Cohen kappa, Bland-Altman analyses, and analysis of 
      variance. RESULTS: In the test cohort, for lesion size smaller than 10 mm (n = 
      30), 10-20 mm (n = 35), and larger than 20 mm (n = 40), the detection sensitivity 
      of the automated method was 10%, 71%, and 85%; positive predictive value was 25%, 
      83%, and 94%; Dice similarity coefficient was 0.14, 0.53, and 0.68; maximum 
      symmetric surface distance was 5.2, 6.0, and 10.4 mm; and average symmetric 
      surface distance was 2.7, 1.7, and 2.8 mm, respectively. For manual and 
      user-corrected segmentation, kappa values were 0.42 (95% confidence interval: 0.24, 
      0.63) and 0.52 (95% confidence interval: 0.36, 0.72); normalized interreader 
      agreement for lesion volume was -0.10 +/- 0.07 (95% confidence interval) and -0.10 
      +/- 0.08; and mean interaction time was 7.7 minutes +/- 2.4 (standard deviation) and 
      4.8 minutes +/- 2.1 (P < .001), respectively. CONCLUSION: Automated detection and 
      segmentation of CLM by using deep learning with convolutional neural networks, 
      when manually corrected, improved efficiency but did not substantially change 
      agreement on volumetric measurements.(c) RSNA, 2019Supplemental material is

TI  - Deep Learning-based CT Image Reconstruction: Initial Evaluation Targeting 
      Hypovascular Hepatic Metastases.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of a deep learning-based reconstruction (DLR) 
      method on the conspicuity of hypovascular hepatic metastases on abdominal CT 
      images. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study with institutional review 
      board approval included 58 patients with hypovascular hepatic metastases. A 
      radiologist recorded the standard deviation of attenuation in the paraspinal 
      muscle as the image noise and the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). CNR was 
      calculated as region of interest ([ROI](L) - ROI(T))/N, where ROI(L) is the mean 
      liver parenchyma attenuation, ROI(T), the mean tumor attenuation, and N, the 
      noise. Two other radiologists graded the conspicuity of the liver lesion on a 
      five-point scale where 1 is unidentifiable and 5 is detected without diagnostic 
      compromise. Only the smallest liver lesion in each patient, classified as smaller 
      or larger than 10 mm, was evaluated. The difference between hybrid iterative 
      reconstruction (IR) and DLR images was determined by using a two-sided Wilcoxon 
      signed-rank test. RESULTS: The image noise was significantly lower, and the CNR 
      was significantly higher on DLR images than hybrid IR images (median image noise: 
      19.2 vs 12.8 HU, P < .001; median CNR: tumors < 10 mm: 1.9 vs 2.5; tumors > 10 
      mm: 1.7 vs 2.2, both P < .001). The scores for liver lesions were significantly 
      higher for DLR images than hybrid IR images (P < .01 for both in tumors smaller 
      or larger than 10 mm). CONCLUSION: DLR improved the quality of abdominal CT 
      images for the evaluation of hypovascular hepatic metastases.(c) RSNA,

TI  - Automatic Hip Fracture Identification and Functional Subclassification with Deep 
      Learning.
PG  - e190023

LID - e190023
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the feasibility of automatic identification and 
      classification of hip fractures using deep learning, which may improve outcomes 
      by reducing diagnostic errors and decreasing time to operation. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Hip and pelvic radiographs from 1118 studies were reviewed, and 3026 
      hips were labeled via bounding boxes and classified as normal, displaced femoral 
      neck fracture, nondisplaced femoral neck fracture, intertrochanteric fracture, 
      previous open reduction and internal fixation, or previous arthroplasty. A deep 
      learning-based object detection model was trained to automate the placement of 
      the bounding boxes. A Densely Connected Convolutional Neural Network (or 
      DenseNet) was trained on a subset of the bounding box images, and its performance 
      was evaluated on a held-out test set and by comparison on a 100-image subset with 
      two groups of human observers: fellowship-trained radiologists and orthopedists; 
      senior residents in emergency medicine, radiology, and orthopedics. RESULTS: The 
      binary accuracy for detecting a fracture of this model was 93.7% (95% confidence 
      interval [CI]: 90.8%, 96.5%), with a sensitivity of 93.2% (95% CI: 88.9%, 97.1%) 
      and a specificity of 94.2% (95% CI: 89.7%, 98.4%). Multiclass classification 
      accuracy was 90.8% (95% CI: 87.5%, 94.2%). When compared with the accuracy of 
      human observers, the accuracy of the model achieved an expert-level 
      classification, at the very least, under all conditions. Additionally, when the 
      model was used as an aid, human performance improved, with aided resident 
      performance approximating unaided fellowship-trained expert performance in the 
      multiclass classification. CONCLUSION: A deep learning model identified and 
      classified hip fractures with expert-level performance, at the very least, and 
      when used as an aid, improved human performance, with aided resident performance 
      approximating that of unaided fellowship-trained attending 
      physicians.Supplemental material is available for this article.(c) RSNA, 2020.

AB  - PURPOSE: To develop a fully automated algorithm for spleen segmentation and to 
      assess the performance of this algorithm in a large dataset. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: In this retrospective study, a three-dimensional deep learning network 
      was developed to segment the spleen on thorax-abdomen CT scans. Scans were 
      extracted from patients undergoing oncologic treatment from 2014 to 2017. A total 
      of 1100 scans from 1100 patients were used in this study, and 400 were selected 
      for development of the algorithm. For testing, a dataset of 50 scans was 
      annotated to assess the segmentation accuracy and was compared against the 
      splenic index equation. In a qualitative observer experiment, an enriched set of 
      100 scan-pairs was used to evaluate whether the algorithm could aid a radiologist 
      in assessing splenic volume change. The reference standard was set by the 
      consensus of two other independent radiologists. A Mann-Whitney U test was 
      conducted to test whether there was a performance difference between the 
      algorithm and the independent observer. RESULTS: The algorithm and the 
      independent observer obtained comparable Dice scores (P = .834) on the test set 
      of 50 scans of 0.962 and 0.964, respectively. The radiologist had an agreement 
      with the reference standard in 81% (81 of 100) of the cases after a visual 
      classification of volume change, which increased to 92% (92 of 100) when aided by 
      the algorithm. CONCLUSION: A segmentation method based on deep learning can 
      accurately segment the spleen on CT scans and may help radiologists to detect 
      abnormal splenic volumes and splenic volume changes.Supplemental material is

      Scans Using Sparsified Training.

AB  - PURPOSE: To improve the robustness of deep learning-based glioblastoma 
      segmentation in a clinical setting with sparsified datasets. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: In this retrospective study, preoperative T1-weighted, T2-weighted, 
      T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and postcontrast T1-weighted MRI 
      from 117 patients (median age, 64 years; interquartile range [IQR], 55-73 years; 
      76 men) included within the Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation (BraTS) 
      dataset plus a clinical dataset (2012-2013) with similar imaging modalities of 
      634 patients (median age, 59 years; IQR, 49-69 years; 382 men) with glioblastoma 
      from six hospitals were used. Expert tumor delineations on the postcontrast 
      images were available, but for various clinical datasets, one or more sequences 
      were missing. The convolutional neural network, DeepMedic, was trained on 
      combinations of complete and incomplete data with and without site-specific data. 
      Sparsified training was introduced, which randomly simulated missing sequences 
      during training. The effects of sparsified training and center-specific training 
      were tested using Wilcoxon signed rank tests for paired measurements. RESULTS: A 
      model trained exclusively on BraTS data reached a median Dice score of 0.81 for 
      segmentation on BraTS test data but only 0.49 on the clinical data. Sparsified 
      training improved performance (adjusted P < .05), even when excluding test data 
      with missing sequences, to median Dice score of 0.67. Inclusion of site-specific 
      data during sparsified training led to higher model performance Dice scores 
      greater than 0.8, on par with a model based on all complete and incomplete data. 
      For the model using BraTS and clinical training data, inclusion of site-specific 
      data or sparsified training was of no consequence. CONCLUSION: Accurate and 
      automatic segmentation of glioblastoma on clinical scans is feasible using a 
      model based on large, heterogeneous, and partially incomplete datasets. 
      Sparsified training may boost the performance of a smaller model based on public 
      and site-specific data.Supplemental material is available for this

TI  - Subspecialty-Level Deep Gray Matter Differential Diagnoses with Deep Learning and 
      Bayesian Networks on Clinical Brain MRI: A Pilot Study.

AB  - PURPOSE: To develop and validate a system that could perform automated diagnosis 
      of common and rare neurologic diseases involving deep gray matter on clinical 
      brain MRI studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, multimodal 
      brain MRI scans from 212 patients (mean age, 55 years +/- 17 [standard deviation]; 
      113 women) with 35 neurologic diseases and normal brain MRI scans obtained 
      between January 2008 and January 2018 were included (110 patients in the training 
      set, 102 patients in the test set). MRI scans from 178 patients (mean age, 48 
      years +/- 17; 106 women) were used to supplement training of the neural networks. 
      Three-dimensional convolutional neural networks and atlas-based image processing 
      were used for extraction of 11 imaging features. Expert-derived Bayesian networks 
      incorporating domain knowledge were used for differential diagnosis generation. 
      The performance of the artificial intelligence (AI) system was assessed by 
      comparing diagnostic accuracy with that of radiologists of varying levels of 
      specialization by using the generalized estimating equation with robust variance 
      estimator for the top three differential diagnoses (T3DDx) and the correct top 
      diagnosis (TDx), as well as with receiver operating characteristic analyses. 
      RESULTS: In the held-out test set, the imaging pipeline detected 11 key features 
      on brain MRI scans with 89% accuracy (sensitivity, 81%; specificity, 95%) 
      relative to academic neuroradiologists. The Bayesian network, integrating imaging 
      features with clinical information, had an accuracy of 85% for T3DDx and 64% for 
      TDx, which was better than that of radiology residents (n = 4; 56% for T3DDx, 36% 
      for TDx; P < .001 for both) and general radiologists (n = 2; 53% for T3DDx, 31% 
      for TDx; P < .001 for both). The accuracy of the Bayesian network was better than 
      that of neuroradiology fellows (n = 2) for T3DDx (72%; P = .003) but not for TDx 
      (59%; P = .19) and was not different from that of academic neuroradiologists (n = 
      2; 84% T3DDx, 65% TDx; P > .09 for both). CONCLUSION: A hybrid AI system was 
      developed that simultaneously provides a quantitative assessment of disease 
      burden, explainable intermediate imaging features, and a probabilistic 
      differential diagnosis that performed at the level of academic neuroradiologists. 
      This type of approach has the potential to improve clinical decision making for 
      common and rare diseases.Supplemental material is available for this article.(c)

AB  - PURPOSE: To develop a machine learning model to classify the severity grades of 
      pulmonary edema on chest radiographs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this 
      retrospective study, 369 071 chest radiographs and associated radiology reports 
      from 64 581 patients (mean age, 51.71 years; 54.51% women) from the MIMIC-CXR 
      chest radiograph dataset were included. This dataset was split into patients with 
      and without congestive heart failure (CHF). Pulmonary edema severity labels from 
      the associated radiology reports were extracted from patients with CHF as four 
      different ordinal levels: 0, no edema; 1, vascular congestion; 2, interstitial 
      edema; and 3, alveolar edema. Deep learning models were developed using two 
      approaches: a semisupervised model using a variational autoencoder and a 
      pretrained supervised learning model using a dense neural network. Receiver 
      operating characteristic curve analysis was performed on both models. RESULTS: 
      The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for 
      differentiating alveolar edema from no edema was 0.99 for the semisupervised 
      model and 0.87 for the pretrained models. Performance of the algorithm was 
      inversely related to the difficulty in categorizing milder states of pulmonary 
      edema (shown as AUCs for semisupervised model and pretrained model, 
      respectively): 2 versus 0, 0.88 and 0.81; 1 versus 0, 0.79 and 0.66; 3 versus 1, 
      0.93 and 0.82; 2 versus 1, 0.69 and 0.73; and 3 versus 2, 0.88 and 0.63. 
      CONCLUSION: Deep learning models were trained on a large chest radiograph dataset 
      and could grade the severity of pulmonary edema on chest radiographs with high 
      performance.Supplemental material is available for this article.See also the

AB  - COVID-19 outbreak has put the whole world in an unprecedented difficult situation 
      bringing life around the world to a frightening halt and claiming thousands of 
      lives. Due to COVID-19's spread in 212 countries and territories and increasing 
      numbers of infected cases and death tolls mounting to 5,212,172 and 334,915 (as 
      of May 22 2020), it remains a real threat to the public health system. This paper 
      renders a response to combat the virus through Artificial Intelligence (AI). Some 
      Deep Learning (DL) methods have been illustrated to reach this goal, including 
      Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), and 
      Long/Short Term Memory (LSTM). It delineates an integrated bioinformatics 
      approach in which different aspects of information from a continuum of structured 
      and unstructured data sources are put together to form the user-friendly 
      platforms for physicians and researchers. The main advantage of these AI-based 
      platforms is to accelerate the process of diagnosis and treatment of the COVID-19 
      disease. The most recent related publications and medical reports were 
      investigated with the purpose of choosing inputs and targets of the network that 
      could facilitate reaching a reliable Artificial Neural Network-based tool for 
      challenges associated with COVID-19. Furthermore, there are some specific inputs 
      for each platform, including various forms of the data, such as clinical data and 
      medical imaging which can improve the performance of the introduced approaches 
      toward the best responses in practical applications.

TI  - Chest X-ray Analysis With Deep Learning-Based Software as a Triage Test for 
      Pulmonary Tuberculosis: An Individual Patient Data Meta-Analysis of Diagnostic 
      Accuracy.
PG  - 1390-1400
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciab639 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Automated radiologic analysis using computer-aided detection software 
      (CAD) could facilitate chest X-ray (CXR) use in tuberculosis diagnosis. There is 
      little to no evidence on the accuracy of commercially available deep 
      learning-based CAD in different populations, including patients with 
      smear-negative tuberculosis and people living with human immunodeficiency virus 
      (HIV, PLWH). METHODS: We collected CXRs and individual patient data (IPD) from 
      studies evaluating CAD in patients self-referring for tuberculosis symptoms with 
      culture or nucleic acid amplification testing as the reference. We reanalyzed 
      CXRs with three CAD programs (CAD4TB version (v) 6, Lunit v3.1.0.0, and qXR v2). 
      We estimated sensitivity and specificity within each study and pooled using IPD 
      meta-analysis. We used multivariable meta-regression to identify characteristics 
      modifying accuracy. RESULTS: We included CXRs and IPD of 3727/3967 participants 
      from 4/7 eligible studies. 17% (621/3727) were PLWH. 17% (645/3727) had 
      microbiologically confirmed tuberculosis. Despite using the same threshold score 
      for classifying CXR in every study, sensitivity and specificity varied from study 
      to study. The software had similar unadjusted accuracy (at 90% pooled 
      sensitivity, pooled specificities were: CAD4TBv6, 56.9% [95% confidence interval 
      CI: 51.7-61.9]; Lunit, 54.1% [95% CI: 44.6-63.3]; qXRv2, 60.5% [95% CI: 
      51.7-68.6]). Adjusted absolute differences in pooled sensitivity between PLWH and 
      HIV-uninfected participants were: CAD4TBv6, -13.4% [-21.1, -6.9]; Lunit, +2.2% 
      [-3.6, +6.3]; qXRv2: -13.4% [-21.5, -6.6]; between smear-negative and 
      smear-positive tuberculosis was: were CAD4TBv6, -12.3% [-19.5, -6.1]; Lunit, 
      -17.2% [-24.6, -10.5]; qXRv2, -16.6% [-24.4, -9.9]. Accuracy was similar to human 
      readers. CONCLUSIONS: For CAD CXR analysis to be implemented as a 
      high-sensitivity tuberculosis rule-out test, users will need threshold scores 
      identified from their own patient populations and stratified by HIV and smear 
      status.

AB  - PURPOSE: To test the efficacy of lesion segmentation using a deep learning 
      algorithm on non-contrast material-enhanced CT (NCCT) images with synthetic 
      lesions resembling acute infarcts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective 
      study, 40 diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesions in patients with acute stroke 
      (median age, 69 years; range, 62-76 years; 17 women; screened between 2011 and 
      2017) were coregistered to 40 normal NCCT scans (median age, 70 years; range, 
      55-76 years; 25 women; screened between 2008 and 2011), which produced 640 
      combinations of DWI-NCCT with and without lesions for training (n = 420), 
      validation (n = 110), and testing (n = 110). The signal intensity on the NCCT 
      scans was depressed by 4 HU (a 13% drop) in the region of the diffusion-weighted 
      lesion. Two U-Net architectures (standard and symmetry aware) were trained with 
      two different training strategies. One was a naive strategy, in which the model 
      started training with random coefficients. The other was a progressive strategy, 
      which started with coefficients derived from a model trained on a dataset with 
      lesions that were depressed by 10 HU. The Dice scores from the two architectures 
      and training strategies were compared from the test dataset. RESULTS: Dice scores 
      of symmetry-aware U-Nets were 25% higher than those of standard U-Nets (median, 
      0.49 vs 0.65; P < .001). Use of a progressive training strategy had no clear 
      effect on model performance. CONCLUSION: Symmetry-aware U-Nets offer promise for 
      segmentation of acute stroke lesions on NCCT scans.Keywords: Adults,

AB  - Accurate identification of metallic orthopedic implant design is important for 
      preoperative planning of revision arthroplasty. Surgical records of implant 
      models are frequently unavailable. The aim of this study was to develop and 
      evaluate a convolutional neural network for identifying orthopedic implant models 
      using radiographs. In this retrospective study, 427 knee and 922 hip unilateral 
      anteroposterior radiographs, including 12 implant models from 650 patients, were 
      collated from an orthopedic center between March 2015 and November 2019 to 
      develop classification networks. A total of 198 images paired with autogenerated 
      image masks were used to develop a U-Net segmentation network to automatically 
      zero-mask around the implants on the radiographs. Classification networks 
      processing original radiographs, and two-channel conjoined original and 
      zero-masked radiographs, were ensembled to provide a consensus prediction. 
      Accuracies of five senior orthopedic specialists assisted by a reference 
      radiographic gallery were compared with network accuracy using McNemar exact 
      test. When evaluated on a balanced unseen dataset of 180 radiographs, the final 
      network achieved a 98.9% accuracy (178 of 180) and 100% top-three accuracy (180 
      of 180). The network performed superiorly to all five specialists (76.1% [137 of 
      180] median accuracy and 85.6% [154 of 180] best accuracy; both P < .001), with 
      robustness to scan quality variation and difficult to distinguish implants. A 
      neural network model was developed that outperformed senior orthopedic 
      specialists at identifying implant models on radiographs; real-world application 
      can now be readily realized through training on a broader range of implants and 
      joints, supported by all code and radiographs being made freely available.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the generalizability of a deep learning pneumothorax detection 
      model on datasets from multiple external institutions and examine patient and 
      acquisition factors that might influence performance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 
      this retrospective study, a deep learning model was trained for pneumothorax 
      detection by merging two large open-source chest radiograph datasets: 
      ChestX-ray14 and CheXpert. It was then tested on six external datasets from 
      multiple independent institutions (labeled A-F) in a retrospective case-control 
      design (data acquired between 2016 and 2019 from institutions A-E; institution F 
      consisted of data from the MIMIC-CXR dataset). Performance on each dataset was 
      evaluated by using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 
      analysis, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values, 
      with two radiologists in consensus being used as the reference standard. Patient 
      and acquisition factors that influenced performance were analyzed. RESULTS: The 
      AUCs for pneumothorax detection for external institutions A-F were 0.91 (95% CI: 
      0.88, 0.94), 0.97 (95% CI: 0.94, 0.99), 0.91 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.97), 0.98 (95% CI: 
      0.96, 1.0), 0.97 (95% CI: 0.95, 0.99), and 0.92 (95% CI: 0.90, 0.95), 
      respectively, compared with the internal test AUC of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.92, 0.93). 
      The model had lower performance for small compared with large pneumothoraces 
      (AUC, 0.88 [95% CI: 0.85, 0.91] vs AUC, 0.96 [95% CI: 0.95, 0.97]; P = .005). 
      Model performance was not different when a chest tube was present or absent on 
      the radiographs (AUC, 0.95 [95% CI: 0.92, 0.97] vs AUC, 0.94 [95% CI: 0.92, 
      0.05]; P > .99). CONCLUSION: A deep learning model trained with a large volume of 
      data on the task of pneumothorax detection was able to generalize well to 
      multiple external datasets with patient demographics and technical parameters 
      independent of the training data.Keywords: Thorax, Computer

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the performance of a deep learning-based algorithm for 
      automatic detection and labeling of rib fractures from multicenter chest CT 
      images. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 10 943 patients 
      (mean age, 55 years; 6418 men) from six hospitals (January 1, 2017 to December 
      30, 2019), which consisted of patients with and without rib fractures who 
      underwent CT. The patients were separated into one training set (n = 2425), two 
      lesion-level test sets (n = 362 and 105), and one examination-level test set (n = 
      8051). Free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) score (mean 
      sensitivity of seven different false-positive rates), precision, sensitivity, and 
      F1 score were used as metrics to assess rib fracture detection performance. Area 
      under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and 
      specificity were employed to evaluate the classification accuracy. The mean Dice 
      coefficient and accuracy were used to assess the performance of rib labeling. 
      RESULTS: In the detection of rib fractures, the model showed an FROC score of 
      84.3% on test set 1. For test set 2, the algorithm achieved a detection 
      performance (precision, 82.2%; sensitivity, 84.9%; F1 score, 83.3%) comparable to 
      three radiologists (precision, 81.7%, 98.0%, 92.0%; sensitivity, 91.2%, 78.6%, 
      69.2%; F1 score, 86.1%, 87.2%, 78.9%). When the radiologists used the algorithm, 
      the mean sensitivity of the three radiologists showed an improvement (from 79.7% 
      to 89.2%), with precision achieving similar performance (from 90.6% to 88.4%). 
      Furthermore, the model achieved an AUC of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.91, 0.94), sensitivity 
      of 87.9% (95% CI: 83.7%, 91.4%), and specificity of 85.3% (95% CI: 74.6%, 89.8%) 
      on test set 3. On a subset of test set 1, the model achieved a Dice score of 
      0.827 with an accuracy of 96.0% for rib segmentation. CONCLUSION: The developed 
      deep learning algorithm was capable of detecting rib fractures, as well as 
      corresponding anatomic locations on CT images.Keywords CT, Ribs(c) RSNA, 2021.

AB  - In 2020, the Radiological Society of North America and Society of Thoracic 
      Radiology sponsored a machine learning competition to detect and classify 
      pulmonary embolism (PE). This challenge was one of the largest of its kind, with 
      more than 9000 CT pulmonary angiography examinations comprising almost 1.8 
      million expertly annotated images. More than 700 international teams competed to 
      predict the presence of PE on individual axial images, the overall presence of PE 
      in the CT examination (with chronicity and laterality), and the ratio of right 
      ventricular size to left ventricular size. This article presents a detailed 
      overview of the second-place solution. Source code and models are available at

AB  - Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained to identify abnormalities on upper 
      extremity radiographs achieved an AUC of 0.844 with a frequent emphasis on 
      radiograph laterality and/or technologist labels for decision-making. Covering 
      the labels increased the AUC to 0.857 (p = .02) and redirected CNN attention from 
      the labels to the bones. Using images of radiograph labels alone, the AUC was 
      0.638, indicating that radiograph labels are associated with abnormal 
      examinations. Potential radiographic confounding features should be considered 
      when curating data for radiology CNN development.

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether deep learning algorithms developed in a public 
      competition could identify lung cancer on low-dose CT scans with a performance 
      similar to that of radiologists. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective 
      study, a dataset consisting of 300 patient scans was used for model assessment; 
      150 patient scans were from the competition set and 150 were from an independent 
      dataset. Both test datasets contained 50 cancer-positive scans and 100 
      cancer-negative scans. The reference standard was set by histopathologic 
      examination for cancer-positive scans and imaging follow-up for at least 2 years 
      for cancer-negative scans. The test datasets were applied to the three 
      top-performing algorithms from the Kaggle Data Science Bowl 2017 public 
      competition: grt123, Julian de Wit and Daniel Hammack (JWDH), and Aidence. Model 
      outputs were compared with an observer study of 11 radiologists that assessed the 
      same test datasets. Each scan was scored on a continuous scale by both the deep 
      learning algorithms and the radiologists. Performance was measured using 
      multireader, multicase receiver operating characteristic analysis. RESULTS: The 
      area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.877 (95% CI: 
      0.842, 0.910) for grt123, 0.902 (95% CI: 0.871, 0.932) for JWDH, and 0.900 (95% 
      CI: 0.870, 0.928) for Aidence. The average AUC of the radiologists was 0.917 (95% 
      CI: 0.889, 0.945), which was significantly higher than grt123 (P = .02); however, 
      no significant difference was found between the radiologists and JWDH (P = .29) 
      or Aidence (P = .26). CONCLUSION: Deep learning algorithms developed in a public 
      competition for lung cancer detection in low-dose CT scans reached performance 
      close to that of radiologists.Keywords: Lung, CT, Thorax, Screening, Oncology
